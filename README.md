Welcome to [Free Code Camp's](http://freecodecamp.com) Asset Repository
=========

This is where we store all of the design assets for Free Code Camp's open source community.

We welcome contributions from designers! Take a look at [our open issues](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/assets/issues). All contributions will remain Creative Commons licensed. 

You can also ask [@hallaathrad in Gitter](https://gitter.im/Hallaathrad) if you have any questions about contributing designs to Free Code Camp's open source community.

Please feel free to use these assets to promote Free Code Camp or your city's campsite. 

Though these assets are Creative Commons licensed, we're trademarking the name "Free Code Camp" itself to prevent scammers from trying to impersonate our organization. If you have questions about this, email us and we'll reply promptly: team at freecodecamp com.
